1. Intro                                                            *NERDTree*

What is this "NERD tree"??

The NERD tree allows you to explore your filesystem and to open files and
directories. It presents the filesystem to you in the form of a tree which you
manipulate with the keyboard and/or mouse. It also allows you to perform
simple filesystem operations so you can alter the tree dynamically.

The following features and functionality are provided by the NERD tree:
    * Files and directories are displayed in a hierarchical tree structure
    * Different highlighting is provided for the following types of nodes:
        * files
        * directories
        * sym-links
        * windows .lnk files
        * read-only files
    * Many (customisable) mappings are provided to manipulate the tree:
        * Mappings to open/close/explore directory nodes
        * Mappings to open files in new/existing windows/tabs     
        * Mappings to change the current root of the tree 
        * Mappings to navigate around the tree 
        * ...
    * Most NERD tree navigation can also be done with the mouse  
    * Dynamic customisation of tree content
        * custom file filters to prevent e.g. vim backup files being displayed
        * optional displaying of hidden files (. files)
        * files can be "turned off" so that only directories are displayed
    * A textual filesystem menu is provided which allows you to
      create/delete/rename file and directory nodes as well as copy (for
      supported OSs)
    * The position and size of the NERD tree window can be customised 
    * The order in which the nodes in the tree are listed can be customised.
    * A model of your filesystem is created/maintained as you explore it. This
      has several advantages:
        * All filesystem information is cached and is only re-read on demand
        * If you revisit a part of the tree that you left earlier in your
          session, the directory nodes will be opened/closed as you left them       
    * The script remembers the cursor position and window position in the NERD
      tree so you can toggle it off (or just close the tree window) and then
      reopen it (with NERDTreeToggle) the NERD tree window will appear EXACTLY
      as you left it
    * You can have a separate NERD tree for each tab

2. Functionality provided                              *NERDTreeFunctionality* 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Commands                                               *NERDTreeCommands*

:NERDTree [start-directory]                                 *:NERDTree*
                Opens a fresh NERD tree in [start-directory] or the current
                directory if [start-directory] isn't specified.
                For example: >
                    :NERDTree /home/marty/vim7/src
<               will open a NERD tree in /home/marty/vim7/src.

:NERDTreeToggle [start-directory]                           *:NERDTreeToggle*
                If a NERD tree already exists for this tab, it is reopened and
                rendered again.  If no NERD tree exists for this tab then this
                command acts the same as the |:NERDTree| command.

:NERDTreeClose
                Close the NERD tree in this tab.

2.3. The filesystem menu                                 *NERDTreeFilesysMenu*

The purpose of the filesystem menu is to allow you to perform basic filesystem
operations quickly from the NERD tree rather than the console.  

The filesystem menu can be accessed with 'm' mapping and has four supported
operations: >
    1. Adding nodes.
    2. Move nodes.
    3. Deleting nodes.
    3. Copying nodes.
<
1. Adding nodes:
To add a node move the cursor onto (or anywhere inside) the directory you wish
to create the new node inside. Select the 'add node' option from the
filesystem menu and type a filename. If the filename you type ends with a '/'
character then a directory will be created. Once the operation is completed,
the cursor is placed on the new node.

2. Move nodes:
To move/rename a node, put the cursor on it and select the 'move' option from
the filesystem menu.  Enter the new location for the node and it will be
moved.  If the old file is open in a buffer, you will be asked if you wish to
delete that buffer. Once the operation is complete the cursor will be placed
on the renamed node.

3. Deleting nodes:
To delete a node put the cursor on it and select the 'delete' option from the
filesystem menu. After confirmation the node will be deleted. If a file is
deleted but still exists as a buffer you will be given the option to delete
that buffer. 

4. Copying nodes:
To copy a node put the cursor on it and select the 'copy' option from the
filesystem menu. Enter the new location and you're done. Note: copying is
currently only supported for *nix operating systems. If someone knows a
one line copying command for windows that doesnt require user confirmation
then id be grateful if you'd email me.

==============================================================================
3. Customisation                                             *NERDTreeOptions*


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. Customisation summary                             *NERDTreeOptionSummary*

The script provides the following options that can customise the behaviour the
NERD tree. These options should be set in your vimrc.

|loaded_nerd_tree|              Turns off the script.

|NERDChristmasTree|             Tells the NERD tree to make itself colourful
                                and pretty.

|NERDTreeAutoCenter|            Controls whether the NERD tree window centers
                                when the cursor moves within a specified
                                distance to the top/bottom of the window.
|NERDTreeAutoCenterThreshold|   Controls the sensitivity of autocentering.

|NERDTreeCaseSensitiveSort|     Tells the NERD tree whether to be case
                                sensitive or not when sorting nodes.

|NERDTreeChDirMode|             Tells the NERD tree if/when it should change
                                vim's current working directory.

|NERDTreeHighlightCursorline|   Tell the NERD tree whether to highlight the
                                current cursor line.

|NERDTreeIgnore|                Tells the NERD tree which files to ignore.

|NERDTreeMouseMode|             Tells the NERD tree how to handle mouse
                                clicks.

|NERDTreeShowFiles|             Tells the NERD tree whether to display files
                                in the tree on startup.

|NERDTreeShowHidden|            Tells the NERD tree whether to display hidden
                                files on startup.

|NERDTreeShowLineNumbers|       Tells the NERD tree whether to display line
                                numbers in the tree window.

|NERDTreeSortOrder|             Tell the NERD tree how to sort the nodes in
                                the tree.

|NERDTreeSplitVertical|         Tells the script whether the NERD tree should
                                be created by splitting the window vertically
                                or horizontally.

|NERDTreeWinPos|                Tells the script where to put the NERD tree
                                window.
                               

|NERDTreeWinSize|               Sets the window size when the NERD tree is

3.2. Customisation details                             *NERDTreeOptionDetails*

To enable any of the below options you should put the given line in your 
~/.vimrc

                                                            *loaded_nerd_tree*              
If this plugin is making you feel homicidal, it may be a good idea to turn it
off with this line in your vimrc: >
    let loaded_nerd_tree=1
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *NERDChristmasTree*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 1.

If this option is set to 1 then some extra syntax highlighting elements are
added to the nerd tree to make it more colourful.

Set it to 0 for a more vanilla looking tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *NERDTreeAutoCenter*                
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 1

If set to 1, the NERD tree window will center around the cursor if it moves to
within |NERDTreeAutoCenterThreshold| lines of the top/bottom of the window.

This is ONLY done in response to tree navigation mappings, 
i.e. |NERDTree-J| |NERDTree-K| |NERDTree-C-J| |NERDTree-c-K| |NERDTree-p|
|NERDTree-P|

The centering is done with a |zz| operation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 *NERDTreeAutoCenterThreshold*                
Values: Any natural number.
Default: 3

This option controls the "sensitivity" of the NERD tree auto centering. See
|NERDTreeAutoCenter| for details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   *NERDTreeCaseSensitiveSort*        
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 0.

By default the NERD tree does not sort nodes case sensitively, i.e. nodes
could appear like this: >
    bar.c
    Baz.c
    blarg.c
    boner.c
    Foo.c
<
But, if you set this option to 1 then the case of the nodes will be taken into
account. The above nodes would then be sorted like this: >
    Baz.c
    Foo.c
    bar.c
    blarg.c
    boner.c
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *NERDTreeChDirMode*                

Values: 0, 1 or 2.
Default: 1.

Use this option to tell the script when (if at all) to change the current
working directory (CWD) for vim.

If it is set to 0 then the CWD is never changed by the NERD tree.

If set to 1 then the CWD is changed when the NERD tree is first loaded to the
directory it is initialized in. For example, if you start the NERD tree with >
    :NERDTree /home/marty/foobar
<
then the CWD will be changed to /home/marty/foobar and will not be changed
again unless you init another NERD tree with a similar command.

If the option is set to 2 then it behaves the same as if set to 1 except that
the CWD is changed whenever the tree root is changed. For example, if the CWD
is /home/marty/foobar and you make the node for /home/marty/foobar/baz the new
root then the CWD will become /home/marty/foobar/baz.

Authors note: at work i have this option set to 1 because i have a giant ctags
file in the root dir of my project. This way i can initialise the NERD tree
with the root dir of my project and always have ctags available to me --- no
matter where i go with the NERD tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 *NERDTreeHighlightCursorline*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 1.

If set to 1, the current cursor line in the NERD tree buffer will be
highlighted. This is done using the |cursorline| option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *NERDTreeIgnore*                
Values: a list of regular expressions.
Default: ['\~$'].

This option is used to specify which files the NERD tree should ignore.  It
must be a list of regular expressions. When the NERD tree is rendered, any
files/dirs that match any of the regex's in NERDTreeIgnore wont be displayed. 

For example if you put the following line in your vimrc: >
    let NERDTreeIgnore=['\.vim$', '\~$']
<
then all files ending in .vim or ~ will be ignored. 

Note: to tell the NERD tree not to ignore any files you must use the following
line: >
    let NERDTreeIgnore=[]
<

The file filters can be turned on and off dynamically with the |NERDTree-f|
mapping.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *NERDTreeMouseMode*                
Values: 1, 2 or 3.
Default: 1.

If set to 1 then a double click on a node is required to open it. 
If set to 2 then a single click will open directory nodes, while a double
click will still be required for file nodes.
If set to 3 then a single click will open any node.

Note: a double click anywhere on a line that a tree node is on will
activate it, but all single-click activations must be done on name of the node
itself. For example, if you have the following node: >
    | | |-application.rb
<
then (to single click activate it) you must click somewhere in
'application.rb'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *NERDTreeShowFiles*            
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 1.

If this option is set to 1 then files are displayed in the NERD tree. If it is
set to 0 then only directories are displayed.

This option can be toggled dynamically with the |NERDTree-F| mapping and is
useful for drastically shrinking the tree when you are navigating to a
different part of the tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *NERDTreeShowHidden*            
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 0.

This option tells vim whether to display hidden files by default. This option
can be dynamically toggled with the |NERDTree-H| mapping.
Use one of the follow lines to set this option: >
    let NERDTreeShowHidden=0
    let NERDTreeShowHidden=1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     *NERDTreeShowLineNumbers*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 0.

This option tells vim whether to display line numbers for the NERD tree
window.  Use one of the follow lines to set this option: >
    let NERDTreeShowLineNumbers=0
    let NERDTreeShowLineNumbers=1
<
                                                       
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *NERDTreeSortOrder*
Values: a list of regular expressions.
Default: ['\/$', '*', '\.swp$',  '\.bak$', '\~$']

This option is set to a list of regular expressions which are used to
specify the order of nodes under their parent.

For example, if the option is set to: >
    ['\.vim$', '\.c$', '\.h$', '*', 'foobar']
<
then all .vim files will be placed at the top, followed by all .c files then
all .h files. All files containing the string 'foobar' will be placed at the
end.  The star is a special flag: it tells the script that every node that
doesnt match any of the other regexps should be placed here.

If no star is present in NERDTreeSortOrder then one is automatically appended
to the array.

The regex '\/$' should be used to match directory nodes.

After this sorting is done, the files in each group are sorted alphabetically.

Other examples: >
    (1) ['*', '\/$']
    (2) []
    (3) ['\/$', '\.rb$', '\.php$', '*', '\.swp$',  '\.bak$', '\~$']
<
1. Directories will appear last, everything else will appear above.
2. Everything will simply appear in alphabetical order.
3. Dirs will appear first, then ruby and php. Swap files, bak files and vim
   backup files will appear last with everything else preceding them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       *NERDTreeSplitVertical*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 1.

This option, along with |NERDTreeWinPos|, is used to determine where the NERD
tree window appears. 

If it is set to 1 then the NERD tree window will appear on either the left or
right side of the screen (depending on the |NERDTreeWinPos| option).

If it set to 0 then the NERD tree window will appear at the top of the screen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *NERDTreeWinPos*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 1.

This option works in conjunction with the |NERDTreeSplitVertical| option to
determine where NERD tree window is placed on the screen.

If the option is set to 1 then the NERD tree will appear on the left or top of
the screen (depending on the value of |NERDTreeSplitVertical|). If set to 0,
the window will appear on the right or bottom of the screen. 

This option is makes it possible to use two different explorer type
plugins simultaneously. For example, you could have the taglist plugin on the
left of the window and the NERD tree on the right.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *NERDTreeWinSize*
Values: a positive integer.
Default: 31.

This option is used to change the size of the NERD tree when it is loaded.

==============================================================================
                                                     *NERDTreePublicFunctions*
5. Public functions      ~

The script provides 2 public functions for your hacking pleasure. Their
signatures are: >
    function! NERDTreeGetCurrentNode()
    function! NERDTreeGetCurrentPath()
<
The first returns the node object that the cursor is currently on, while the
second returns the corresponding path object.

This is probably a good time to mention that the script implements prototype
style OO. To see the functions that each class provides you can read look at
the code.

Use the node objects to manipulate the structure of the tree. Use the path
objects to access the data the tree represents and to make changes to the
filesystem.

==============================================================================
5. TODO list                                                    *NERDTreeTodo*

Window manager integration?

6. The Author                                                 *NERDTreeAuthor*

The author of the NERD tree is a terrible terrible monster called Martyzilla
who gobbles up small children with milk and sugar for breakfast. He has an odd
love/hate relationship with computers (but monsters hate everything by nature
you know...) which can be awkward for him since he is a pro computer nerd for
a living.

He can be reached at martin_grenfell at msn.com. He would love to hear from
you, so feel free to send him suggestions and/or comments about this plugin.
Don't be shy --- the worst he can do is slaughter you and stuff you in the
fridge for later ;)

7. Changelog                                               *NERDTreeChangelog* 

2.9.0

    - path handling improvements, thanks to Zhang Shuhan for heaps of
      testing/bug reports
        * improved how paths are stored, now the script will no longer get
          confused about drives on MF Windows
        * made the script way better at handling paths with strange characters
          in them (eg '$@; etc)
    - applied a patch from Cory Echols
        * add the command :NERDTreeClose to close the tree for the current tab
        * set the filetype for the NERD tree buffer to "nerdtree"

2.8.0
    - added an option to enable/disable line numbers in the NERD tree window,
      thanks to Olivier Yiptong for the email.

2.7.1
    - Changed the keys for the filesystem menu to be mnemonic rather than
      arbitrary integers
    - Documented the copying functionality in the filesystem menu

2.7.0
    - Bug fix: Now when you have the tree on the right and you open it with
      multiple windows stacked, it will take up the full height of the vim
      window. 
    - Now line numbers always turned off in the tree by default
    - Implemented copying of nodes (via the filesystem menu) for *nix/macosx
    - took the help doc out of the script and repackaged the whole thing as a
      zip

2.6.2
    - Now when you try to open a file node into a window that is modified, the
      window is not split if the &hidden option is set. Thanks to  Niels Aan
      de Brugh for this suggestion.

2.6.1
    - Fixed a major bug with the <tab> mapping. Thanks to Zhang Weiwu for
      emailing me.

2.6.0
    - Extended the behaviour of <c-j/k>. Now if the cursor is on a file node
      and you use <c-j/k> the cursor will jump to its PARENTS next/previous
      sibling. Go :help NERDTree-c-j and :help NERDTree-c-k for info.
    - Extended the behaviour of the J/K mappings. Now if the cursor is on the
      last child of a node and you push J/K it will jump down to the last child
      of the next/prev of its parents siblings that is open and has children.
      Go :help NERDTree-J and :help NERDTree-K for info.
    - The goal of these changes is to make tree navigation faster.
    - Reorganised the help page a bit.
    - Removed the E mapping.
    - bugfixes

2.5.0
    - Added an option to enforce case sensitivity when sorting tree nodes.
      Read :help NERDTreeCaseSensitiveSort for details.  (thanks to Michael
      Madsen for emailing me about this). Case sensitivity defaults to off.
    - Made the script echo a "please wait" style message when opening large
      directories. Thanks to AOYAMA Shotaro for this suggestion.
    - Added 2 public functions that can be used to retrieve the treenode and
      path that the cursor is on. Read :help NERDTreePublicFunctions for
      details (thanks again to AOYAMA Shotaro for the idea :).
    - added 2 new mappings for file nodes: "g<tab>" and "go". These are the
      same as the "<tab>" and "o" maps except that the cursor stays in the
      NERDTree. Note: these maps are slaved to the o and <tab> mappings, so if
      eg you remap "<tab>" to "i" then the "g<tab>" map will also be changed
      to "gi".
    - Renamed many of the help tags to be simpler.
    - Simplified the ascii "graphics" for the filesystem menu
    - Fixed bugs.
    - Probably created bugs.
    - Refactoring.

2.4.0
    - Added the P mapping to jump to the tree root.
    - Added window centering functionality that can be triggered when doing
      using any of the tree nav mappings. Essentially, if the cursor comes
      within a certain distance of the top/bottom of the window then a zz is
      done in the window. Two related options were added: NERDTreeAutoCenter
      to turn this functionality on/off, and NERDTreeAutoCenterThreshold to
      control how close the cursor has to be to the window edge to trigger the
      centering.

2.3.0
    - Tree navigation changes:
      - Added J and K mappings to jump to last/first child of the current dir.
        Options to customise these mappings have also been added.
      - Remapped the jump to next/prev sibling commands to be <C-j> and <C-k> by
        default.
      These changes should hopefully make tree navigation mappings easier to
      remember and use as the j and k keys are simply reused 3 times (twice
      with modifier keys).

    - Made it so that, when any of the tree filters are toggled, the cursor
      stays with the selected node (or goes to its parent/grandparent/... if
      that node is no longer visible)
    - Fixed an error in the doc for the mouse mode option.
    - Made the quickhelp correctly display the current single/double click
      mappings for opening nodes as specified by the NERDTreeMouseMode option.
    - Fixed a bug where the script was spazzing after prompting you to delete
      a modified buffer when using the filesystem menu.  
    - Refactoring
2.2.3
    - Refactored the :echo output from the script.
    - Fixed some minor typos in the doc.
    - Made some minor changes to the output of the 'Tree filtering mappings'
      part of the quickhelp 

2.2.2
    - More bugfixes... doh.

2.2.1
    - Bug fix that was causing an exception when closing the nerd tree. Thanks
      to Tim carey-smith and Yu Jun for pointing this out.

2.2.0
    - Now 'cursorline' is set in the NERD tree buffer by default. See :help
      NERDTreeHighlightCursorline for how to disable it.

2.1.2
    - Stopped the script from clobbering the 1,2,3 .. 9 registers.
    - Made it "silent!"ly delete buffers when renaming/deleting file nodes.
    - Minor correction to the doc
    - Fixed a bug when refreshing that was occurring when the node you
      refreshed had been deleted externally.
    - Fixed a bug that was occurring when you open a file that is already open
      and modified.

2.1.1
    - Added a bit more info about the buffers you are prompted to delete when
      renaming/deleting nodes from the filesystem menu that are already loaded
      into buffers.
    - Refactoring and bugfixes

2.1.0
    - Finally removed the blank line that always appears at the top of the
      NERDTree buffer
    - Added NERDTreeMouseMode option. If set to 1, then a double click is
      required to activate all nodes, if set to 2 then a single click will
      activate directory nodes, if set to 3 then a single click will activate
      all nodes.
    - Now if you delete a file node and have it open in a buffer you are given
      the option to delete that buffer as well. Similarly if you rename a file
      you are given the option to delete any buffers containing the old file
      (if any exist)
    - When you rename or create a node, the cursor is now put on the new node,
      this makes it easy immediately edit  the new file.
    - Fixed a bug with the ! mapping that was occurring on windows with paths
      containing spaces.
    - Made all the mappings customisable. See |NERD_tree-mappings| for
      details. A side effect is that a lot of the "double mappings" have
      disappeared. E.g 'o' is now the key that is used to activate a node,
      <CR> is no longer mapped to the same.
    - Made the script echo warnings in some places rather than standard echos
    - Insane amounts of refactoring all over the place.

2.0.0
    - Added two new NERDChristmasTree decorations. First person to spot them
      and email me gets a free copy of the NERDTree.
    - Made it so that when you jump around the tree (with the p, s and S
      mappings) it is counted as a jump by vim. This means if you, eg, push
      'p' one too many times then you can go `` or ctrl-o.
    - Added a new option called NERDTreeSortOrder which takes an array of
      regexs and is used to determine the order that the treenodes are listed
      in. Go :help NERDTreeSortOrder for details.
    - Removed the NERDTreeSortDirs option because it is consumed by
      NERDTreeSortOrder
    - Added the 'i' mapping which is the same as <tab> but requires less
      effort to reach.
    - Added the ! mapping which is  used to execute file in the tree (after it
      prompts you for arguments etc)
